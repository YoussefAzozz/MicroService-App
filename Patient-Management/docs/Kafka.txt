Of course we know kafka that enables Asynchronous communication between the services

-> First we must know that the default port of the kafka is 9092 , ok what about the port 9094 ???






We need to know that the message that is sent to the kafka is key-value message
-- Each topic in the kafka must have group(services that interested in that topic and consumes it)


A topic in kafka is split into partitions




Why the message value(not the key) is converted to bytes of array
